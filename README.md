============
Experimental Lua -> TypeScript Declaration generator.

* NOTE: This is not a feature-complete tool, it is still being experimented on so doesn't function standalone with production code yet
* If I do decide this is worth doing further, I will refactor everything to be a lot tidier and easier to understand. Sorry.
